            <h4>His Side</h4>
            <p>
              I had bought the engagement ring on January 17th, 2017 thinking it would be the year that I proposed to Dana, but I didn’t know how to make it more special in my own way. When I heard my grandma and uncle were selling their house in Vancouver, I knew I had to take her there to visit the place I had so many fond and eventful memories of as a kid. I began researching for ideal engagement locations, and I decided on one of the most beautiful botanical gardens in the world, The Butchart Gardens.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout the first half of the trip, I had to hide the ring in my backpack, and it was especially difficult to keep the ring hidden in my sweater on the way to the gardens. I proposed to her at the iconic Sunken Garden on August 16th, 2017. As nervous as I was, it was honestly the easiest decision I had to make in my entire life.
            </p>

            <h4>Her Side</h4>
            <p>
              Jay led me to believe the proposal would happen towards the end of the year (I kept asking him when it would happen since I was getting impatient), so I was actually completely surprised when he proposed. I had even been joking the day before about how I wouldn’t have minded if he proposed in Vancouver, and he acted as if that would have been really inconvenient since he’d have to bring the ring onto the plane, and I agreed, oblivious to his scheming. As we arrived at The Butchart Gardens, I had only questioned why he wanted to keep his sweater on since it wasn’t too chilly, and why he chose to stand on a specific side next to me when taking pictures. But distracted by the beauty of the gardens and trying not to trip everywhere I walked, I didn’t question him any further.
            </p>
            <p>
              We walked up to a quieter spot, where we stood overlooking the Sunken Garden. It sounds a little cliche, but once he took my hands and began proposing, it felt like my surroundings were a blur, and all I could see and hear was him. Whenever I would daydream about him proposing, I would imagine myself teasing him by not answering immediately, or by responding with “I don’t know”, but when he got down on one knee and asked, I completely forgot and quickly said “yes”. Even though we had already moved into our new house and talked about marriage constantly (after dating for a year, I...well, I created an email account for the future Dana Chiao), there was a special kind of happiness I felt when he would introduce me as his fiance.
