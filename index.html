        <h4>2011</h4>
        <p>
          As Dana walked into calculus class her freshman year at the University of Maryland, she noticed Jay and thought he was pretty attractive. However, after several classes, she actually thought he was really annoying since he would talk and laugh loudly throughout the lecture. She had the urge one day to turn around and tell him to “shut up,” but she decided against it. Dana and Jay ended up officially meeting on February 16th, 2011 at a fundraising event for the UMD Dragonboat Club, which they both joined later that year. They were both slightly interested in each other, but they didn’t think the other person felt the same.

        <h4>2012</h4>
        <p>
          They didn’t have any classes together during sophomore year, but they began talking to each other more often and looked for excuses to see each other throughout the week. He had been sending a few flirty texts here and there, but he was too nervous to confess how he felt. In the end, Dana got impatient and confronted Jay about whether or not he liked her. They began dating May 2nd, 2012.

          They were that semi-crazy couple that began talking about marriage very early on… as in the first several months of dating. Of course, like most couples they had their arguments, but with time their relationship matured and they learned to appreciate their differences

            <h4>2016</h4>
            <p>
              On November 18th, 2016, they bought their first house together and moved in that winter. It was terrifying to know that they were getting themselves deeper into “adulting,” but it was an exciting milestone in their lives.

            <p>
              And on August 16th, 2017, Jay (finally) got down on one knee to propose!

            <h4>His Side</h4>
            <p>
              I had bought the engagement ring on January 17th, 2017 thinking it would be the year that I proposed to Dana, but I didn’t know how to make it more special in my own way. When I heard my grandma and uncle were selling their house in Vancouver, I knew I had to take her there to visit the place I had so many fond and eventful memories of as a kid. I began researching for ideal engagement locations, and I decided on one of the most beautiful botanical gardens in the world, The Butchart Gardens.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout the first half of the trip, I had to hide the ring in my backpack, and it was especially difficult to keep the ring hidden in my sweater on the way to the gardens. I proposed to her at the iconic Sunken Garden on August 16th, 2017. As nervous as I was, it was honestly the easiest decision I had to make in my entire life.

            <h4>Her Side</h4>
            <p>
              Jay led me to believe the proposal would happen towards the end of the year (I kept asking him when it would happen since I was getting impatient), so I was actually completely surprised when he proposed. I had even been joking the day before about how I wouldn’t have minded if he proposed in Vancouver, and he acted as if that would have been really inconvenient since he’d have to bring the ring onto the plane, and I agreed, oblivious to his scheming. As we arrived at The Butchart Gardens, I had only questioned why he wanted to keep his sweater on since it wasn’t too chilly, and why he chose to stand on a specific side next to me when taking pictures. But distracted by the beauty of the gardens and trying not to trip everywhere I walked, I didn’t question him any further.
            </p>
            <p>
              We walked up to a quieter spot, where we stood overlooking the Sunken Garden. It sounds a little cliche, but once he took my hands and began proposing, it felt like my surroundings were a blur, and all I could see and hear was him. Whenever I would daydream about him proposing, I would imagine myself teasing him by not answering immediately, or by responding with “I don’t know”, but when he got down on one knee and asked, I completely forgot and quickly said “yes”. Even though we had already moved into our new house and talked about marriage constantly (after dating for a year, I...well, I created an email account for the future Dana Chiao), there was a special kind of happiness I felt when he would introduce me as his fiance.

We were those girls that would pass notes to each other during class, between class, after class, and would still call each other after school.
